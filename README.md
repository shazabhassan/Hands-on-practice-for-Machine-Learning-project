# Hands-on-practice for Machine Learning project
This repository will include a bunch of projects that will be completed with guidance of [Siddhardhan](https://www.youtube.com/@Siddhardhan) through his great YouTube videos. This is a way to both document my learning journey and to put out in the open what I'm currently learning/I've learned.
